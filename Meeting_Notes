Team meeting for 9 hours straight!!! 3pm EST - 12am EST
Obviously, a lot was completed


1. MapFragment was updated, now popups are displayed in the correct locations, can be collected
2. Can collect a popup only if in range
3. Having trouble figuring out the border (gree/grey/fade/etc.) signaling if you're in range or not
4. Profile Fragment had a lot of updates! including editable profile photop, display name, and description
5. Having trouble implementing the search icon in the action bar menu for one fragment in the Nav Drawer, not all of them
6. Restructured how we stored pop-ups in firebase so they're easier to access and iterate through
7. Made use of shared preferences with regards to storing current user data
8. Detail Page for a popup displays correct name, picture, and tag
9. Going to keep grinding starting in the morning tomorrow!
10. More changes/improvements were definitely made, it's hard to keep track of them all
