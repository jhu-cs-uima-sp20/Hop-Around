# Hop-Around

Notes about login:
Here's a previously created account to fiddle around with:
Email: ee@jhu.edu  
Password: ee
We have pop-ups documented/collected on that profile from 4/27/19.
The current display name for that profile is "meme!", which is what you use to search for that user.

Notes about location services:
Because we are located all over the country (and world), it is hard to test our app using the user's actual location data.
What we have done is for every time a user logs into the app, their location is randomly generated to somewhere on Homewood campus!
Pop-ups posted by that user are linked to that randomly generated location.

Feel free to create as many accounts (and pop-ups) as you'd like!
